            <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
            <p>I'm a Computer Science Engineering student and a passionate Frontend Developer.
                Currently exploring MERN stack, learning React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
                 Iâ€™m also diving into DBMS, Python, and solving problems on CodeChef to sharpen my problem-solving skills.
